ðŸ’¡ 6. **Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons**

There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer arrayÂ `points`Â whereÂ `points[i] = [xstart, xend]`Â denotes a balloon whoseÂ **horizontal diameter**Â stretches betweenÂ `xstart`Â andÂ `xend`. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot upÂ **directly vertically**Â (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon withÂ `xstart`Â andÂ `xend`Â isÂ **burst**Â by an arrow shot atÂ `x`Â ifÂ `xstart <= x <= xend`. There isÂ **no limit**Â to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the arrayÂ `points`, returnÂ *theÂ **minimum**Â number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons*.

**Example 1:**
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
